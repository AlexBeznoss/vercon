# Vercon

Vercon - a handy little gem that takes the pain out of writing tests for your Ruby projects. ðŸ”¥

The name Vercon comes from the Latin "verum conantur", meaning "they strive for truth". Vercon automatically generate test files and even though they will not always will be perfect, but at least it will save some time writting them manually.

It's build on top of Claude 3. It sends the source code of the Ruby file alongside with available factory names and current test file (in case one exists).

Claude analyzes your code to understand how it works, then uses that knowledge to put together relevant tests. 

Just let the AI handle the tedious test writing for you ðŸš€ 

Give Vercon a try and save yourself some time and headaches when it comes to testing your Ruby apps. 

Easy, efficient, no fuss ðŸ‘Œ
